---

## A. Security Baseline

- [x] `[all]` SECURITY.md exists (report email, supported versions, response timeline)
- [x] `[all]` README includes threat model paragraph (data touched, data NOT touched, permissions required)
- [x] `[all]` No secrets, tokens, or credentials in source or diagnostics output
- [x] `[all]` No telemetry by default — state it explicitly even if obvious

### Default safety posture

- [ ] `[cli|mcp|desktop]` SKIP: VS Code extension — no CLI, MCP, or desktop flags
- [ ] `[cli|mcp|desktop]` SKIP: VS Code extension — no CLI, MCP, or desktop flags
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server

## B. Error Handling

- [x] `[all]` Errors follow the Structured Error Shape: `code`, `message`, `hint`, `cause?`, `retryable?`
- [ ] `[cli]` SKIP: not a CLI
- [ ] `[cli]` SKIP: not a CLI
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[desktop]` SKIP: not a desktop app
- [x] `[vscode]` Errors surface via VS Code notification API — no silent failures

## C. Operator Docs

- [x] `[all]` README is current: what it does, install, usage, supported platforms + runtime versions
- [x] `[all]` CHANGELOG.md (Keep a Changelog format)
- [x] `[all]` LICENSE file present and repo states support status
- [ ] `[cli]` SKIP: not a CLI
- [ ] `[cli|mcp|desktop]` SKIP: VS Code extension — no CLI, MCP, or desktop flags
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[complex]` SKIP: not a complex tool

## D. Shipping Hygiene

- [x] `[all]` `verify` script exists (test + build + smoke in one command)
- [x] `[all]` Version in manifest matches git tag
- [x] `[all]` Dependency scanning runs in CI (ecosystem-appropriate)
- [x] `[all]` Automated dependency update mechanism exists
- [ ] `[npm]` SKIP: published as VSIX via vsce, not to npm registry
- [x] `[npm]` `engines.node` set
- [x] `[npm]` Lockfile committed
- [x] `[vsix]` `vsce package` produces clean .vsix with correct metadata
- [ ] `[desktop]` SKIP: not a desktop app

## E. Identity (soft gate — does not block ship)

- [x] `[all]` Logo in README header
- [x] `[all]` Translations (polyglot-mcp, 8 languages)
- [x] `[org]` Landing page (@mcptoolshop/site-theme)
- [x] `[all]` GitHub repo metadata: description, homepage, topics

## Gate Rules

**Hard gate (A–D):** Must pass before any version is tagged or published.
If a section doesn't apply, mark `SKIP:` with justification — don't leave it unchecked.

**Soft gate (E):** Should be done. Product ships without it, but isn't "whole."
